### Other FTC Info:

*   [Game materials](http://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/game-and-season-info)

    Things like game manuals etc.  Very useful and important stuff.

### Processing:

I recommend the team member to experiment with __Processing__: a programming
language and environment for designing interactive graphics and animations.  It
has a lot of very similar principles to the programming environment we will be
using for the robot.

*   Processing [download](https://processing.org/download/?processing)

*   Processing [tutorials](https://processing.org/tutorials/)

    Number of useful tutorials on Processing. I recommend starting with
    "Getting Started", also Coordinate Syetem and Shapes.
