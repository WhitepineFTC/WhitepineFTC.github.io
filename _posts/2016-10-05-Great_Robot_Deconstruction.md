title: The Great Robot Deconstruction

Today we welcomed several new members.  We watched the [game
video]("https://www.youtube.com/iQLrcQbm8cg") again, had a talk about _Gracious
Professionalism_, and then proceeded to take apart the last year's robot.  The team
did a great job on it, now pretty much only the base with the wheels remain.  The
general consensus was that we will keep the base and build the new robot on top
of it.

Now it is really the time for all new members to think about the new robot
design.  Watch the game video again, and think how can we build the robot so
that it will fulfill at least some of the scoring tasks in the game. __Talk to
other team members about your ideas__!  Everybody should have a notebook (one where the
pages can be pulled out and included in a 3-ring binder) and use it to write
down ideas and make sketches of robot designs.  You may want to watch FTC
videos on youtube to see how other teams designed things in the previous years.

The programmers had some more practice with Processing.  I highly recommend
that all students who are interested in programming download [Processing](https://processing.org/download/?processing) 
to their computers and experiment with it.  Open various examples, study the
code, try to predict what will it do, and try to change it so it will do
something else.  If you create something cool, email me the file, and I will
post it here!

I am looking forward to see you on Friday.
