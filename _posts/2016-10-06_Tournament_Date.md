title: Tournament Date
date: 2016-10-06

We are now officially registered as a team in FTC.  We have been assigned the
first qualifying tournament, it will take place on November 12 in Midland (I
believe it is at the Bullock Creek High School).  We may be also assigned a
second qualifier to go to in the case we do not advance from the first one.  I
am hoping for December 3 in Kettering, that would give us few more weeks to
work.  If I understand it correctly, the second qualifier is optional, so we do
not have to go if we do not want to.

November 12 is Saturday.  There is usually a check in and registration on
Friday evening before the tournament, where we check in our robot and they
verify that it works and meets all the tournament requirements, so the
tournament dates will actually be November 11 evening and November 12 all day.
