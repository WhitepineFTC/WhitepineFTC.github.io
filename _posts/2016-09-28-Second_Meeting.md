The second meeting was on a half day, which is probably why not a lot of
students showed up.  We still had a good attendance, though, 3 of our last
years members came.

We got the last years robot operational, new members have a chance to drive it.
We watched the game video again.  It turns out there was a lot of things
unclear in the video, so we had a long brainstorming session with the [official
game rules](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/ftc/game-manual-part-2.pdf)
and found out these important things:

*   When pressing beacon buttons in the autonomous period, the only thing that
    counts is the color of the beacon at the end of autonomous period.  It is
    the same as for the driver controlled period, but the movie makes it sounds
    like you get points every time you press a beacon.  The movie is wrong.

*   During the autonomous period, it does not matter which robot pushed the
    large ball.  What matters is whether the aliance colored ball touches the
    ground at the end of the autonomous period.

*   When scoring small particles into vortices, it does not matter what color the
    particle is.  The only important thing is the color of the vortex. __However__,
    there is a rule that we overlooked which __prohibits each aliance to handle
    scoring elements of the opposing aliance__.  That means we are only alowed
    to use the particles of our aliance color!  If we shoot such particle into the
    opposing aliance vortex, though, it __will__ count as a point _for the
    opposing aliance_!

    Furter question: what happens if we accidentally handle the particles of the
    opposing aliance color?

There were still some questions that we were not able to answer, for example:

*   Can a red robot park on a blue vortex ramp, or vice versa?  If that
    happens, who gets the points?

There is an official [questions and answers forum](http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/forumdisplay.php?188-FIRST-Tech-Challenge-Velocity-Vortex-Game-Rules) where teams can ask questions like this.  There already are some answered questions.
I _highly recommend_ all team members read the answers.  There are several
answers pertaining to a scoring strategy that we talked about during the
meeting!  It turns out the strategy is actually illegal.

I am looking forward to seeing you next Wednesday!
