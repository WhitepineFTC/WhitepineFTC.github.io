### Update on the last few meetings

Last two meetings were quite successful, the robot is now taking shape, the
team started attaching electrical components, so we should soon be able to
test actual driving.  We have bought a tube for the "particle cannon", and the
team is trying to figure out how to attach it to the robot and how to bring the
collected particles into the tube.  It will still take a lot of work, and our
first tournament is less than 3 weeks away.

On the programming side, we figured out how to use the new version of the
system (the way opmodes are registered in the system has changed, and is now
much easier, but it confused us for a while).  Our programmers learned how to
control the motors and servos using the x-box controllers, and we basically
have a basic tank drive program, that can also put a servo into one of three
position, determined my the buttons on the controller.  Once the robot is
operational, we will fine tune that to make it easier to drive, and add
controls for other components.  While the builders are getting the robot to a
drivable state, we will work on learning how to program the autonomous mode.

In other news, the high-school team, Heritage HawkBots, have a [new
website](http://hawkbots.net).
